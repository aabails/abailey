Change can be hard for teenagers. Whether it's moving schools, adjusting to new friendships, or experiencing family transitions, these shifts often trigger anxiety and stress.

In this post, I share approaches parents and educators can use to ease these transitions:
- Open and ongoing conversations
- Emphasizing routines and predictability
- Encouraging healthy peer connections
- Building coping strategies through mindfulness and outdoor activity

By validating feelings and offering consistent support, adults can help teens build resilience and confidence in navigating lifeâ€™s changes.
