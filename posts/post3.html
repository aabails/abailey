  <p>
    The transition back to school is a time filled with emotions—for both teens and parents.
    For many young people, it brings excitement: reconnecting with friends, joining activities, and stepping into new opportunities.
    For others, it can stir up worry, self-doubt, or even dread.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a counsellor working closely with teens and families, I often see how this period raises big questions about identity, confidence, and resilience.
    The good news? With care, patience, and a few intentional strategies, families can help turn this transition into an opportunity for growth.

    <h2>1. Acknowledge Their Feelings</h2>
    <p>
      Even when teens appear confident, many quietly carry concerns about academics, friendships, or fitting in.
      Give them permission to share openly without rushing to “fix” things. Sometimes the most powerful support is simply listening and validating:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “It sounds like you’re nervous about math this year. That makes sense—it’s a big step.”
    </blockquote>

    <h2>2. Reset Healthy Routines</h2>
    <p>
      Summer often means late nights, extra screen time, and looser schedules. As school begins, help your teen rebuild routines around
      <strong>sleep, meals, and downtime</strong>. Regular sleep is especially important—well-rested teens are better able to regulate emotions,
      handle stress, and focus in class.

    <h2>3. Encourage Connection</h2>
    <p>
      Adolescence is all about belonging. Encourage your teen to connect through sports, clubs, arts, or simply making plans with friends.
      Social connection is one of the strongest protective factors for mental health during this stage of life.

    <h2>4. Model Calm and Confidence</h2>
    <p>
      Teens are quick to sense the emotional tone at home. If you’re anxious about academics, they’ll likely pick up on it.
      By staying calm, focusing on positives, and showing confidence in their ability to adapt, you give your teen the reassurance that they are capable and supported.

    <h2>5. Keep Communication Open</h2>
    <p>Create regular opportunities to check in—over dinner, on the drive home, or during evening downtime. Try gentle, open-ended prompts like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“What part of the day are you most looking forward to?”</li>
      <li>“What feels tricky right now?”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These questions signal that you’re available when challenges arise.</p>

    <h2>6. Know When to Seek Extra Support</h2>
    <p>
      If your teen’s stress feels overwhelming—or you notice persistent changes in sleep, appetite, or mood—it may be time for additional help.
      Professional counselling provides a safe, non-judgmental space for teens to process emotions, strengthen coping strategies, and build resilience.

    <h2>A Final Thought</h2>
    <p>
      Transitions are a natural part of growing up. While they can be bumpy, they’re also rich opportunities for learning and growth.
      With encouragement and support, teens can face new beginnings with resilience—and families can grow stronger in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your teen could benefit from extra support as they return to school, I welcome you to reach out.
      Together, we can create a safe space for them to explore challenges, build confidence, and find balance during this important stage of life.
