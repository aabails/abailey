    <h1>Free Counselling Templates for ReMarkable</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500"><em>By Aaron Bailey, Counsellor</em></p>
  </header>

  <p>
    Over the years I’ve developed a series of counselling templates to help streamline sessions,
    track progress, and make planning easier. These forms were created with high school students
    in mind, but they’re flexible enough for many different counselling contexts.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m sharing them here for free as downloadable files that can be imported directly to your
    ReMarkable tablet or used as PDFs.
