    <h1>Using the ReMarkable 2 for Clinical Counselling Notes</h1>
    <p class="text-gray-500"><em>By Aaron Bailey, Counsellor</em></p>

  <p>
    In my counselling practice, keeping clear and structured notes is essential. Over time,
    I’ve found that the <strong>ReMarkable 2 tablet</strong> provides the perfect balance:
    it keeps me paper-free while still giving me the focus and tactile experience of writing by hand.
    Unlike a laptop or phone, the ReMarkable minimizes distractions and helps me stay present
    with clients during sessions.
  </p>

  <p>
    To make the most of this workflow, I designed a <em>Clinical Counselling Notes Template</em>
    specifically for my ReMarkable. It allows me to quickly capture key points, structure my
    observations, and plan for future sessions in a way that is professional and efficient.
